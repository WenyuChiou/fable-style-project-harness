# BOOTSTRAP — start here

This repo is a **Fable-method project operating harness**: the observable,
documented working method of the `method-harness-compiler` project, packaged
as files you load incrementally. It is not general documentation and it is
not a prompt dump. It tells you *how to work on that project*, in a way that
survives model and session changes.

> **Not working on `method-harness-compiler`?** Use the portable path
> instead: read `core/GLOBAL_BOOTSTRAP.md` (core/ only — skip the ladder below).
>
> **Maintaining a harness itself** (audit/simplify/benchmark CLAUDE.md,
> hooks, skills, scheduled reviews — this repo's or another)? Read
> `.claude/skills/adaptive-harness/SKILL.md` — runtime-agnostic entry; the
> runners are plain Python CLIs any agent can execute.
>
> **Making a completion claim?** If your deliverable will assert something is
> done / passing / fixed / ready / safe / staged — even when the prompt never
> says "done" — load `docs/completion-honesty-gate.md` +
> `prompts/claude-code-completion-integrity.md` BEFORE you write the claim.
> (Skip for a one-line status remark that is not a merge / release /
> safety-relevant claim.)

## Startup sequence (mandatory, in order)

1. Read `context/L0_bootstrap.md` — what this harness is and is not.
2. Read `context/L2_current_phase.md` — where the project actually stands
   right now, what is allowed, what is forbidden.
3. Read `context/L3_task_router.md` — classify the task you were given into
   one of the 8 task types.
4. Load your route's bundle in ONE call: `python scripts/route_pack.py
   <task_type>` (entry + every start+required file's full text — the
   measured turn-cost fix; serial per-file reads cost extra turns whose
   standing-context replay ate the savings). Entry-only fallback:
   `scripts/route_show.py <task_type>` or grep `- id: ROUTE-<...>` in
   `ROUTES.yaml` — never Read the file whole. Open `optional` files only
   with a stated one-line reason.

## Rules that are never optional

- **Do not read the whole repo.** If you feel you need everything, you have
  either misclassified the task or hit a real routing gap — say so
  explicitly instead of bulk-loading (`context/L4_progressive_disclosure_policy.md`).
- **Stay inside the current phase.** Work outside the `allowed` list in L2
  requires an explicit GO / CONDITIONAL_GO / NO_GO decision, not silence.
- **Self-check before returning.** Score your draft against the rubric(s)
  your route names. Fix what scores below 3 or disclose why you cannot.

## Output contract

Every substantive deliverable ends with four short sections:

1. **Decision** — what you concluded or produced (one paragraph or verdict).
2. **Risks** — what could be wrong with it, honestly stated.
3. **Required changes** — what must change in the project (or in this
   harness) as a result; "none" is an acceptable answer.
4. **Next actions** — the smallest concrete next steps, in order.

## After the work

If your work changed the project's direction, phase, or standing decisions,
update `memory/` per `operating_model/project_memory_policy.yaml` — append,
never overwrite. If it exposed a gap in this harness itself, record it; the
harness improves through recorded friction, exactly like the project it
distills.
