# fable-style-project-harness

A **Fable-style Adaptive Harness Skill System**: an operating harness
distilled from the observable working method of the
`method-harness-compiler` project (distilled at commit `965c68e`,
2026-07-02), plus the maintenance system that keeps a harness alive —
reviewed, simplified, benchmarked, and rolled forward instead of rotting as
a static prompt collection.

Two layers, one discipline:

- **The distilled harness** packages the source project's demonstrated
  procedures — phase gates, falsifiable evaluation gates, honest-failure
  publishing, layered review, no-fabrication code gates,
  discovery-without-execution tool boundaries, cost-aware routing, and
  append-only memory — into a progressive-disclosure context system an
  agent loads incrementally instead of reading the whole source repo.
- **The adaptive layer** (Phase 1–2, 2026-07-06) keeps any harness honest
  over time: a deterministic AI-review runner
  (`scripts/run_ai_review.py`, 7 modes), an adaptive rolling-loop runner
  (`scripts/run_adaptive_harness_review.py`, 10 modes), shared report/
  recommendation schemas (`schemas/review_report.schema.yaml`,
  `schemas/recommendation.schema.yaml`), semantic checklists
  (`prompts/ai-review-modes.md`), a canonical Codex delegation policy
  (`docs/codex-delegation-policy.md`), pre-registered A/B benchmarks
  (`benchmarks/`), and a skill adapter
  (`.claude/skills/adaptive-harness/SKILL.md`). Contract:
  `docs/ai_review_adaptive_harness_integration.md` — deterministic scripts
  compute, LLMs judge, humans approve, scheduled runs stay report-only.

## What this repo IS

- **Method summaries, procedures, rubrics, examples, and decision records**
  that any observer of the `method-harness-compiler` repo could reconstruct
  from its docs, schemas, scripts, tests, example packages, and git log
  (17+ commits with rich trailers).
- **A progressive-disclosure context package**: small layered files
  (`context/L0`–`L5`), a task router (`ROUTES.yaml`), per-route file lists,
  and datasets keyed by stable IDs (`TE-###`, `FM-###`, `EC-###`, `RE-###`,
  `ROUTE-*`, `RUBRIC-*`, `PLAYBOOK-*`).
- **Its own git repo**, deliberately gitignored by the parent project
  (parent commit `965c68e`: "private harness distillation must never ship
  with the (future-public) repo").

## What this repo is NOT

- **Not a prompt dump.** Nothing here is a private system prompt, hidden
  chain-of-thought, or internal model instruction. Everything is
  reconstructed from published artifacts.
- **Not hidden internals.** No API keys, tokens, personal contact info, or
  private chat content — see [`docs/publication_status.md`](docs/publication_status.md).
- **Not a static skill package.** The adaptive layer exists precisely so the
  harness gets reviewed and pruned on a cadence; a growing pile of unreviewed
  rules is a defect the system itself must flag.
- **Not the method-harness-compiler itself.** The source project compiles
  expert-methodology packages; this repo distills *how that project is
  operated* so the same working method can be applied elsewhere.

## Entry points (Skill-like activation)

Three thin entry files let different runtimes *discover and launch* this
harness on their own, instead of a human explaining it each time:

| File | Convention it serves | When it fires |
|---|---|---|
| [`BOOTSTRAP.md`](BOOTSTRAP.md) | Universal shortest entry | Paste-a-pointer for any model: "read BOOTSTRAP.md and follow it" |
| [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) | Repository agent instructions | Auto-read at session start by convention-following coding agents (Codex, Cursor, and similar) |
| [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) | Skill discovery (`name`/`description` frontmatter) | Skill-aware runtimes (Claude Code and similar) surface it as an invocable capability |

All three converge on the same startup ladder below — they are launchers,
not rule stores. The rules stay in the routed files, so the entry layer can
stay short and stable.

A fourth entry, [`core/GLOBAL_BOOTSTRAP.md`](core/GLOBAL_BOOTSTRAP.md), is
the portable path for work on any OTHER project: it loads only the `core/`
discipline layer and never the project-bound files (L1/L2, phase playbooks,
`memory/`).

## How to use it (the reading order)

1. **`context/L0_bootstrap.md`** — the minimal first read. Under 300 words.
2. **`context/L2_current_phase.md`** — what phase the source project is in,
   what is allowed and forbidden right now.
3. **`context/L3_task_router.md`** — classify your task into one of the 8
   pinned routes.
4. **`ROUTES.yaml`** — get the exact file list for your route.
5. **Route files only.** Open the rubrics / playbooks / examples the route
   lists — nothing else, per
   [`context/L4_progressive_disclosure_policy.md`](context/L4_progressive_disclosure_policy.md).

`context/L1_project_constitution.md` (thesis, non-goals, stable principles)
and `context/L5_full_context_map.md` (one-line directory map) are reference
layers: load them when a route file points to them or when ambiguity
survives the routed files.

## Publication status

**PUBLIC** (visibility verified 2026-07-06). Public-safe posture: no
secrets, no hidden reasoning, no private chat exports, no credentials, no
local telemetry; generated review reports stay gitignored. The repeatable
public-safety review checklist and the honest ledger of outstanding items
(license decision pending) are in
[`docs/publication_status.md`](docs/publication_status.md). The
`HARNESS.yaml` constraints block (`public_safe_after_human_review`,
`no_secrets`, `no_hidden_reasoning`) is binding on every future edit.

## Provenance discipline

Every claim in this repo traces to an observable artifact: a file path in
`method-harness-compiler` (docs/, schemas/, scripts/, tests/, the three
example packages) or a commit hash in its git log. Dataset records carry a
`source_artifact` field and a `synthetic` flag; grounded (`synthetic:
false`) records are preferred. If you cannot cite an artifact, do not write
the claim — the source project's own no-fabrication rule
(`TODO_FILL`-fails-validation, UNSCORED-never-guessed) applies here too.
