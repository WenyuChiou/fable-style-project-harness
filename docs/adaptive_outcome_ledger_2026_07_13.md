# Adaptive Outcome Ledger Evidence

Status: the pre-registered integrity and overhead gate passed at commit
`d8fe0e85ebd5ecf6c2cbf1402a7312a3ae731a9d`.

## Problem under test

The old rolling review searched free-form commit prose for `applies` or
`resolves`. A partial-evidence note followed by `no closure intended` could
therefore look resolved, while real outcomes lived only in the latest derived
report and could be lost or repeated on later runs.

The replacement accepts only:

- an exact legacy commit subject ending in `applies REC-*` or `resolves REC-*`;
- a structured `Harness-Outcome` trailer whose evidence path is a tracked file
  in the same commit.

It distinguishes applied-but-unvalidated work from validated or rejected
closure, persists the newest outcome, and lets a later evidence-backed
`reopened` event return the recommendation to the active queue.

## Pre-registered result

| Criterion | Result |
|---|---:|
| Adversarial free-form messages falsely closed | 0/5 |
| Valid closure forms accepted | 2/2 |
| Validated outcome survived later stale-input runs | 3/3 |
| Carried-open regression | unchanged |
| Evidence-backed reopen returned to active queue | pass |
| Adaptive tests | 20/20 |
| Interleaved timing samples | 15 per arm |
| Reported steady-state overhead ratio | 1.028x baseline |
| Pre-registered overhead ceiling | <=1.2x |

The commit-bound timing record reports medians of 435 ms and 423 ms and the
1.028x ratio. This establishes that the integrity checks stayed within the
overhead budget. It is not a speedup claim.

## Unknown unknowns found by review

- A cache keyed only by Git HEAD misses an older recommendation introduced by
  a newer review at the same commit. The cache key now includes REC-ID coverage.
- A transient Git scan failure could otherwise advance the cache and suppress
  the retry. Failed scans now remain visible, emit a P1, and do not advance it.
- Evidence added in a later commit must not validate a trailer retroactively;
  the evidence file must exist in the declaring commit.
- Conflicting outcome trailers in one commit now fail closed as unverified.
- The cache fast path could not assume a normal loose branch ref. It now
  resolves `.git` directories or worktree pointers, detached HEAD, and loose
  or packed refs without a Git fork, with `git rev-parse` as a fallback. The
  regression test explicitly pins detached HEAD behavior; packed refs and
  worktree pointers are implemented support, not separately measured claims.

## Supported decision and limits

Keep the ledger because the measured regression set eliminates the tested
false-closure class, preserves outcomes across repeated runs, supports explicit
reopening, and stays within the 1.2x overhead budget.

Do not treat a trailer as proof that the underlying engineering change works.
The ledger proves that evidence is commit-bound and state transitions are
auditable; the referenced evidence still requires its own acceptance gate.
