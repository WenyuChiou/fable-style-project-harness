# L3 — Task Router

> **Working on a project OTHER than `method-harness-compiler`?** →
> `ROUTE-global-orchestration` (`core/` only: start at
> `core/GLOBAL_BOOTSTRAP.md`; do NOT load the project-bound layers —

Classify the task FIRST (restate it in one sentence, name the phase it
touches, check L2's allowed/forbidden list), THEN pick exactly one route
below, THEN load that route's bundle in ONE call — `python
scripts/route_pack.py <task_type>` (entry + every start+required file;
measured 2026-07-11: one-call orientation 0.72x total cost vs free, while
serial route_show+reads broke even on turn overhead). Entry-only fallback:
`scripts/route_show.py <task_type>` (add `--header` on first activation),
or grep `- id: ROUTE-<...>` in `ROUTES.yaml` and read just that block. Do
NOT Read `ROUTES.yaml` whole (measured: one entry is ~13% of the file; the
rest is other routes' lists). Do not open rubric/playbook/example files the
route does not list.

## Route table

| Task type | Route | Classification hint (1 line) |
|---|---|---|
| Phase/milestone gate check, "are we ready to advance", GO/NO_GO decision, development-plan status audit | `ROUTE-phase-review` | Mentions phases, milestones, gates, acceptance criteria, N=2/N=3, or `development_plan.md` |
| Researching/scoring tool sources, MCP registries, skill catalogs; drafting ToolCards; adapter design; reviewing a discovery plan or report for boundary/citation integrity | `ROUTE-tool-discovery` | Mentions registries, MCP servers, skills marketplaces, `tool_sources.yaml`, risk/permission proxies — and must stay metadata-only. A review OF discovery work routes here (subject beats verb), not to `ROUTE-phase-review`, unless it is a gate/GO-NO_GO decision |
| Reviewing a diff, commit range, or PR before merge; staging and commit hygiene | `ROUTE-pr-review` | Mentions diff, commit, review verdict, staged files, explicit-path staging, CI watch |
| Designing an eval, grader, scorecard, pre-registration, outcome eval, or gate metric | `ROUTE-eval-design` | Mentions graders, pass criteria, UNSCORED, pre-register, keyword families, blinded grading, regression floors |
| Recording corrections, friction reports, standard-changelog entries, memory-file updates | `ROUTE-memory-update` | Mentions friction IDs (F#/N3-F#), corrections, JSONL memory, `CHANGELOG_STANDARD.md`, append-only |
| Exporting/installing packages into runtimes; plugin manifests; install verification | `ROUTE-runtime-export` | Mentions plugin.json, marketplace.json, `phc export`, install smoke, fresh-user E2E, SKILL.md pointer |
| Repo hygiene: locale mirror sync, CI config, test-suite upkeep, README/doc drift, gitignore | `ROUTE-repo-maintenance` | Mentions 3-locale READMEs, CI workflow, asset-hygiene tests, drift fixes, cleanup |
| Designing a baseline comparison or A/B experiment (arms, corpus, grading protocol) | `ROUTE-ab-test-design` | Mentions arms, baseline vs harness, persona-prompt comparison, leakage probes, contamination controls |

## Tie-breakers (observable precedents)

- **Review beats build.** If a task both produces a diff and reviews one,
  the review discipline of `ROUTE-pr-review` applies on top of the build
  route — in the source repo nothing ships ungated (every feat commit
  carries `Co-Reviewed-By` trailers).
- **Design beats run.** Designing an eval or A/B protocol is
  `ROUTE-eval-design` / `ROUTE-ab-test-design`; actually RUNNING one is
  gated by L2 (pre-registration must exist BEFORE any model call — the
  Category-7 precedent).
- **Friction found mid-task** → finish the task on its own route, then
  record the friction via `ROUTE-memory-update` (append, never absorb).
- **No route fits** → do not improvise. Halt, state which routes were
  considered and why each fails, and ask. Halt is a success (L1 #10).

## After classifying

Load your route's bundle in one call (`python scripts/route_pack.py
<task_type>`; entry-only: `route_show.py` or grep the `- id:` block), stay
within the files it lists, and follow
`context/L4_progressive_disclosure_policy.md` for any escalation beyond
that list.
