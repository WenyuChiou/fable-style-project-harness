layer: doc
purpose: Append-only log of working-style distillation cycles; one entry per candidate trait or negative finding, each carrying its motivating project, trace, gate label (load-bearing / baseline / quarantined / cosmetic / negative), and cross-project recurrence — the accumulation surface that turns hypotheses into traits over >=2 projects.
read_when: During a distillation cycle when recording candidates/verdicts; deciding whether a candidate has recurred across enough projects to promote.
depends_on:
  - ./setup-checklist.md
  - ./analyst-prompt.md

# Distillation Log

Append-only. Newest last. One entry per candidate trait or negative finding. **Never edit a
past entry** — supersede it with a new entry that references its id (DR-007
corrections-append-never-overwrite). This is the recurrence ledger: a candidate is promoted to a
*trait* only when it recurs across **>=2 projects** with a non-zero base-rate delta each time
(see [`setup-checklist.md`](setup-checklist.md) §2/§3). Load-bearing survivors also land on the
harness surfaces (`memory/lessons_learned.jsonl`, `datasets/edge_cases.yaml`); this log is the
cross-project index that makes recurrence visible.

## Entry template
- **id:** DL-YYYYMMDD-NN
- **project:** <the real project + whether it was git-tracked / had a base-rate arm>
- **candidate:** <one sentence — the observed working-style behaviour>
- **trace:** <exact file/row/line + the downstream decision it changed (two-level)>
- **base-rate delta:** <plain-agent's choice at the same fork vs the subject's — or "NO BASE-RATE RUN">
- **label:** load-bearing | baseline(ceiling) | quarantined | cosmetic | negative-finding
- **recurrence:** <k/N projects this has appeared in; supersedes/relates DL-ids>
- **landing:** <LL-0NN / EC-0NN / none — where it went on the harness surface, or why not>

## Entries
<!-- append below this line; do not rewrite existing entries -->

- **id:** DL-20260704-01
  - **project:** model-routing-benchmark (NOT git-tracked; NO base-rate arm — pilot, negative-findings-only per checklist §5)
  - **candidate:** honest-failure surfacing lives only in the raw-capture layer; the derived report manufactures a false all-green.
  - **trace:** `make_report.py:23` prefer-ok dedup → `canonical_results.jsonl` has 0 `ok:false`; `report_dedup.md` aggregate voice `4/4` with no timeout mention; the real timeout (240s ceiling, no elapsed — `benchmark.py:83-85`) survives only in `raw.jsonl` and is named in exactly one quoted model-output excerpt at `report.md:349`, never in a report's own aggregate voice; the 189.23s post-timeout retry is retained and averaged into the latency column.
  - **base-rate delta:** NO BASE-RATE RUN (n=1, no control arm — cannot separate subject from any agent).
  - **label:** negative-finding
  - **recurrence:** 1/1 project.
  - **landing:** appended LL-018 (`memory/lessons_learned.jsonl`) + EC-025 (`datasets/edge_cases.yaml`). Maps onto existing DR-004 / DR-009 / DR-011 + `docs/completion-honesty-gate.md` (a fresh instance, not a new rule).

- **id:** DL-20260704-02
  - **project:** person-harness-compiler (Fable session `3b07caec`, transcript-based → **clean attribution**; NO base-rate arm yet — Round-1)
  - **candidate:** Round-1 Track-1 distillation of the orchestrator's working-style from a 57-turn build+orchestration transcript.
  - **trace:** `scratchpad/distillation_design/track1_mhc/timeline.md`; workflow `wf_cbf650ca-fd5` (3 lenses → gate → adversarial audit).
  - **base-rate delta:** NO BASE-RATE RUN yet (planned: Opus session `cc8d85c0` as a weak same-task contrast + the H-A/H-B cross-project fork).
  - **label:** 1 LOAD-BEARING (L1 claim-targeted verification) + 7 HYPOTHESIS + 4 NEGATIVE; the adversarial audit demoted 3 load-bearing → 1.
  - **recurrence:** 1/1 project — every trait capped at HYPOTHESIS pending a ≥2nd-project fork.
  - **landing:** appended LL-019 (L1), LL-020 (N2), LL-021 (N4), EC-026 (N3). **N1 (code-review-verdict-not-gating) was INVESTIGATED against the full transcript and DROPPED** — the "same-turn commit / no verdict" basis did not hold; the `code-review` skill ran a real review each time (diff + reads + grep), so the verdict-gating characterization was a condensed-timeline artifact (DR-021 caught it before landing).
  - **base-rate note (superseding, `wf_02456e89-e0d`):** the planned "weak same-task contrast" (Opus session `cc8d85c0`) WAS run and, per its adversarial audit, **cannot subtract baseline** — the Opus arm was ALSO harnessed and on a DIFFERENT project (mhc, not PHC), so all candidate traits (L1/H-A/H-B/H-C) appear in it by harness rule (DR-016/DR-002/DR-009), giving ~zero discriminating information (a MATCH is expected by construction). It establishes only a floor ("none absent under harness on a different project"), not distinctiveness. **The missing instrument is a harness-OFF plain-agent run at the same forks** (setup-checklist §2: no harness, no skill, zero priming) — a harnessed second arm cannot separate harness-imposed from model-native. That experiment (`wf_...` harness-off, plain-Opus vs plain-Fable at the L1/H-B/H-C forks) is the decisive next step; run next.
