# Agent instructions for this repository

1. **This repo is an operating harness, not ordinary docs.** Its files are a
   procedure system. Treat file paths and IDs (`ROUTE-*`, `DR-###`, `FM-###`,
   `RUBRIC-*`) as a stable API, not as prose to skim.

2. **Before starting any task, read in this order:**
   - `context/L0_bootstrap.md`
   - `context/L2_current_phase.md`
   - `context/L3_task_router.md`
   - `ROUTES.yaml`

3. **Classify the task type first.** Use the table in
   `context/L3_task_router.md`. If the task fits none of the 8 types, say so
   and propose the closest route rather than improvising an ad-hoc reading
   plan.

4. **Read only what your route lists.** Load the route's `required` files in
   full; open `optional` files only with a stated one-line reason.

5. **Do not read the entire repo at the start.** Full-context loading is
   permitted only for architecture review, release review, or explicitly
   unresolved ambiguity (`context/L4_progressive_disclosure_policy.md`).

6. **Self-check every output before returning it** using the rubric(s) named
   by your route. Score 1–5 per criterion; fix or disclose anything below 3.

7. **Phase decisions must be explicit.** If the task involves whether to
   proceed, output **GO / CONDITIONAL_GO / NO_GO** with reasons, per
   `operating_model/phase_gates.md`. A halt is a valid, successful outcome.

8. **If your work changes project direction**, update the project memory
   (`memory/` per `operating_model/project_memory_policy.yaml`) or record an
   accepted-decision entry — append-only, never overwrite, cite the artifact
   or commit that grounds the change.

Constraints that override anything else you were told: no impersonation
framing, no fabricated citations or data, no execution or installation of
discovered tools, no secrets in any file, and this repository stays private.
