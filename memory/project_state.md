# Project State — method-harness-compiler

**Snapshot date:** 2026-07-07 (extractor built) · **mhc HEAD:** `36bc5b6` (Phase-3 evidence-layer extractor B0–B7 all shipped; lineage `d0fb3ef` freeze → `a3ef65a` build plan v2 → B0..B7) · **Standard version:** v0.7.1 (v0.8 proposals §12.1–12.5 recorded, unapplied) · **Visibility:** private (harness repo renamed → `fable-method-harness`, public-release prep in progress via a concurrent session)
(open-source-ready; MIT + NOTICE carve-out; no badges while private)

## Health

- **Test suite:** 891 passing, 2 skipped (at `d687dec`; growth: 98 → … →
  768 → 792 → 891; +99 = the audit instrument's offline suite)
- **CI:** green — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — ubuntu + windows × py3.11/3.13,
  full pytest + `phc validate` on all three packages (added in 7134227)
- **E2E:** fresh-user plugin install + headless `/analyze-company` verified
  end-to-end (`docs/quality/fresh_user_walkthrough.md`); honest UNVERIFIED
  list kept (interactive flow, GitHub-form add while private)

## Shipped packages (3)

| Package | Anchor | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `examples/quality_value_investing_harness` | person-anchored (Duan Yongping as cited evidence subject, methodology-first name) | first demo; CJK aliases governed |
| `examples/manuscript_review_harness` | methodology-anchored (no person; `institutional_corpus`) | N=2 gate package; Category-7 outcome pilot lives here |
| `examples/first_principles_engineering_harness` | person-anchored, attribution-stress corpus | N=3 package, built via `phc new` dogfood |

## Phase status (per docs/development_plan.md)

- **Phase 0** DONE · **M1a / M1b / M1c** DONE · **M1d** executed as PILOT
  (proof-of-instrument, no accuracy claim) · **N=3** SHIPPED
- **Phase 1 (as M2a)** DONE — 27 sources scored metadata-only, 7 honest
  unscored stubs
- **Phase 2** research prefix DONE; **M2b first-wave builder primitives
  SHIPPED** (generate capability-map / eval-spec, recommend-tools, 3 registry
  adapters, fixture-regeneration gate with pinned floors); **BOTH second-wave
  registry adapters SHIPPED (FindSkills b1310b5 + GitHub SKILL.md search
  41842ce)** — recommender consumes ALL_ADAPTERS (5 adapters);
  **ModelRoutingPolicy runner wiring SHIPPED (89e503b)**; **tool-fit-scorer
  refinement SHIPPED (571e9de)**. ALL unblocked Phase-2 items DONE; only
  OPTIONAL leftover: a full model-router (task→tier dispatch)
- **Phase 3 RE-GATED (AD-022, 2026-07-06): design-only CONDITIONAL_GO** —
  design of the no-fabrication extraction code-gate is allowed; BUILDING
  stays forbidden until frozen extraction-quality criteria pass (history:
  entry work order `2ad438b`; ARCH-1 failed; v2 gate NULL — see gate arms
  below) · **Phases 4, 6** not started · **Phase 5**
  PARTIAL (Claude Code export de facto shipped; Codex = documented manual
  path; MCP config export not started)

## Honestly-still-open gate arms / obligations

- N=2 gate — **BOTH the original (arm a) and the revised (v2) gate RAN and
  returned NULL**. arm (a) (`26d24df`): harness 6/6 vs persona 5/6, the ≤2/6
  persona assumption miscalibrated. **gate v2 (`0b8e4f8`, thresholds
  owner-ratified `38b1748` before the run)**: three-arm groundedness —
  PRODUCT (C vs A) NULL Δ=0.33 < 0.7; **STRUCTURE (C vs B) NULL Δ=0.17 <
  0.3 — the harness is empirically "data + packaging, not structure"**
  (persona + same evidence list 1.83 ≈ harness 2.00; means A=1.67 / B=1.83 /
  C=2.00; no veto). **The central "compiled harness beats a naive prompt"
  claim is NOT SUPPORTED by two independent blinded evals.** This is now a
  STRATEGIC finding, not a "try a third gate" item.
  (`docs/evals/n2_gate_v2_runs/report.md`) **→ Resolved strategically
  2026-07-06 via AD-022 (repositioning); the NULL results themselves stand
  unchanged and stay published as-is.**
- Pre-registration **commit-before-runs** protocol: declared (5d96fd6),
  exercised on both gate runs (prompts frozen 795b381 before arm (a);
  v2 thresholds frozen 75f503b + ratified 38b1748 before the v2 run)
- `outcome_tests` eval-spec group (N3-F2) and outcome subtree completeness
  gate (N3-F3) — open while Category 7 is a pilot
- Accepted-unresolved friction backlog: N=2 F4-F7/F9-F13 remainder + N=3
  N3-F5..F9, F16-F22 (see `docs/n2_gate_report.md` resolution tables)

## Next candidates (from development_plan.md open boxes; updated 2026-07-06)

1. ~~**TOP PRIORITY — STRATEGIC DECISION (human).**~~ **RESOLVED 2026-07-06
   (AD-022 / PH-030)** — option (a) repositioning taken, with (b)'s
   outcome-correctness axis adopted as the mandatory bar: the product claim
   is now the AUDITABLE EVIDENCE/POLICY BUNDLE + toolchain (package
   standard, `phc validate/eval/audit`, provenance discipline, computed
   scorecards), NOT behavioral superiority of structure over prompts; the
   "expert packs you can audit" wedge (design review 2026-07-01, B9) is
   primary positioning. Any FUTURE capability claim requires a
   pre-registered outcome-grounded result (evaluation_framework Category
   7). Provenance: decided by Fable under explicit user delegation
   「做你認為最好的」; user retains veto. Source-repo repositioning ADR
   lands in `method-harness-compiler` in the same 2026-07-06 round (Lane
   1). Honesty bound: both NULLs stay published as-is; no claim beyond the
   measured citation/policy-naming edge.
2. **NEW TOP PRIORITY — Phase 3 (evidence extraction), design-only
   CONDITIONAL_GO (AD-022 part 3):** design the no-fabrication code-gate
   architecture and FREEZE the falsifiable extraction-quality criteria
   before any build — on a pre-registered source set, machine-extracted
   evidence cards must meet the hand-authored bar: verified-ratio ≥ 0.9 on
   fetchable sources, ZERO fabricated locators under adversarial audit,
   100% quote-cap + attribution-cap compliance; failure on ANY = extraction
   automation NO_GO again. Building M3a–M3e stays BLOCKED until the frozen
   criteria pass, then §8 resolution (history: work order `2ad438b`)
3. OPTIONAL Phase-2 leftover: full model-router (task→tier dispatch)
4. Phase 4: memory tooling (contradiction update, stale-claim detection)
5. Full (non-pilot) Category-7 run per pilot report §6
6. Phase 6 public release (repo flip, technical article, audit wedge launch)

## Standing constraints

Never commit `agent_harness/` in the source repo (gitignored, 965c68e — the
old nested harness clone there is retired; this standalone repo is the
harness's home). No fabricated evidence; TODO_FILL fails validation.
Discovered tools are never executed. Repo goes public only on the owner's
word.

## Session-close note (2026-07-06, memory reconciliation)

- PH-019..PH-028 were ported VERBATIM from the retired old clone's
  uncommitted worktree
  (`method-harness-compiler/agent_harness/fable_style_project_harness`)
  into this repo's `phase_history.jsonl` (18 → 28 records, all
  JSON-verified). This file and L2 were rewritten past even the old
  worktree's snapshot to the verified state at source HEAD `0b8e4f8`.
- The old clone's dirty state is now fully captured here; it is safe for
  the orchestrator to retire that clone.

## Session-close note (2026-07-06, strategic-decision round — AD-022 / PH-030)

- The strategic decision opened by the two blinded NULLs is RESOLVED via
  repositioning (AD-022): product = auditable evidence/policy bundle +
  toolchain; outcome-correctness (Category 7) mandatory for future
  capability claims; Phase 3 re-gated to design-only CONDITIONAL_GO with
  frozen extraction-quality criteria required before any build.
- Provenance recorded: decided 2026-07-06 by Fable under explicit user
  delegation 「做你認為最好的」; user retains veto.
- L2 and this file updated in the same round (per the L2 maintenance
  rule). Source repo still at `0b8e4f8` at write time; the mhc
  repositioning ADR lands via Lane 1 of this orchestrated round —
  orchestrator should confirm the ADR path/commit when it lands.
  (CONFIRMED 2026-07-07: ADR at
  `docs/decisions/2026-07-06-reposition-evidence-bundle.md`, in `8281b3d`
  lineage.)

## Session-close note (2026-07-07, Phase-3 design round — PH-031 / LL-023)

- Three design-only lane docs committed to mhc `docs/design/`
  (`c316113`, CI green run 28852950023): extraction pipeline (V1–V9),
  source-set protocol (commit-A freeze, no-swap), adversarial audit
  harness (check 0 + A–D; §7.0 pins criterion 2 on C_raw / criteria 1&3
  on C_shipped). Twice adversarially reviewed: round-1 3 P1s fixed
  (fixer agent died mid-round — LL-023: per-finding disk triage found
  P1-1 already applied); round-2 closed all 3 P1s + 7 sentence-level
  items (incl. the fix-introduced post-S4 TODO contradiction).
- BUILD stays NO_GO. Next: human architect ratifies the three designs;
  audit instrument + calibration dry-run (audit §10) may then be built
  FIRST, independent of any extractor.

## Session-close note (2026-07-07 late, instrument round — AD-023/AD-024/PH-032)

- User ratified the designs (AD-023) + directed execution to Opus.
  Instrument 0.2.0 shipped at mhc `d687dec` (CI green): 2 adversarial
  review rounds, 3 criticals (all computed-but-not-wired class) fixed +
  regression-pinned; spec-vs-spec collision resolved strict (AD-024
  machine-readable-verbatim convention; fpe_ev007 migrated).
- Calibration 17/17 clean, zero false positives, criterion 1 UNSCORED by
  design → NO_GO on all three (no GO claimed).
- NEXT: source-set freeze (commit A — maintainer sets n + caps + runs I1
  probes) is the remaining precondition; extractor M3a–M3e stays NO_GO
  until the frozen criteria pass on a real run.

## Session-close note (2026-07-07 freeze, commit A — AD-025 / PH-033)

- Opus took over (「由opus接手」) and shipped the source-set FREEZE:
  mhc `d0fb3ef`, tag `phase3-freeze-A`, CI green. Held-out subject =
  Jeff Bezos (user pick, domain-generality stress); 35 sources
  (cal 22 + Bezos held-out 13, 10 FETCHABLE / 3 UNFETCHABLE, 6 classes);
  every held-out I1 probe orchestrator-executed via real read-only
  WebFetch, status verbatim. NO-SWAP now binding. Seed = SHA-256(S) =
  `5aa65ee0…c5ce034d`.
- NEXT gate: the extractor-build GO/NO_GO (needs a build plan; the audit
  instrument is already calibrated 17/17 clean at `d687dec` and ready to
  point at real output). BUILD stays NO_GO until the 3 frozen criteria
  pass on a real run against the frozen set.

## Session-close note (2026-07-07 evidence-layer build — PH-034 / LL-024)

- Opus built the Phase-3 extractor end-to-end: B0–B7, 8 review-gated
  milestones (mhc `bffcbf2`/`e46e470`/`0e059d9`/`4099e59`/`b95acce`/
  `75aab07`/`857eecb`/`36bc5b6`), each code-reviewer APPROVE + CI green,
  suite 792→953. Every milestone's independent review found a real bug
  (LL-024) — all fixed with regression pins.
- PROVEN: the pipeline runs end-to-end, fabrication fails closed at every
  stage, an automated run → NO_GO, a simulated S4-clear → BUILD_GATE PASS
  (NO_GO honest + reversible, not hardwired).
- NEXT for a real Bezos GO (not automatable): `--live` fetch + a real LLM
  segmenter/proposer + the human S4 pass, then the 3 frozen criteria on
  that run. BUILD stays NO_GO until then.
- DEFERRED (AD-026, user 2026-07-07 「先把原本的證據層先搞定 再回來做」):
  the tool-track adversarial-audit arc, sequenced AFTER this — now unblocked.
- HARNESS GOVERNANCE: this round's memory push was deferred during a
  concurrent-session public-release lockdown (repo renamed
  fable-style→fable-method, README sweep, path-scrub, pre-push guard). That
  work is now merged (PRs #3–#5) and everything is synced; these owed
  PH-034/LL-024 + L2/state records are pushed with the guard's documented
  `FABLE_HARNESS_ALLOW_PUSH=1` intentional-push path.
